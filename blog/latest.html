		Hi, welcome to my website! This website explores my adventure with tech and current projects that I'm working on and sharing with you!
<br>	With that boring introduction away, lets introduce myself! My name is Alfred, I'm a tech enthusiast who experiments and plays with computers and networking! 
<br>	I've been messing with computers since 2014, I built my first computer (an actual pc) in 2017, I mainly run network simulations and play games. But I also mess with networking.
<br>	I have a little homelab, nothing special, hosting a few VMs to messing with 40gb infiniband. This website will explore and hopefully teach you as well the stuff I do.
<br>	I hope to have a blog posted about every month, some sooner, this website will be updated when the blogs start rolling out on the homepage where you found this article.
<br>	
<br>	Theres a summary of what I hope to achieve with this website.
