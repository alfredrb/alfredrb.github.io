		Dial up, we all heard about it! How it was the ancestor to the modern internet and how it was slow and made loud noises. Or if you picked up the phone line you got disconnected.
<br>	 
<br>	Well today, (to be honest more like 2 years of work and researching,) I finally got 56k dial up working and its actual 56k (k56flex)
<br>	Well to get started lets go a little bit how 56k works and how I manage to achieve it.
<br>	
<br>	High speed dial up such as 56k requires a bit more than just two modems and telephone lines, you need digital phone lines. Well isn't voip digital you may ask? Well yes and no, while it is digital its not the same type of line we need, we need something called PRI (or T1/ISDN) these are digital ciructs that carry 24 phone lines or DS0 and allows us to use digital modems.
<br>	
<br>	Also 56k isn't like your standard dial up connection, we need something called a modem bank and/or digital modems. These modems connect to the PRI line and allows users to dial in with their analog modems. Esseintally Analog to Digital(Phone Company) - Digital to Digital. This allows us to connect at 56k.
<br>	My setup allows us to connect at a little lower speed than that but it is still techincully 56k, k56flex (the first 56k standard.) For this I'm using two freepbx systems (one for digital and analog) connected via a sip trunk and a portmaster 3.
